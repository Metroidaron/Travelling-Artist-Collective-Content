# Welcome to the Traveling Artist Collective!

We collaborate with artists to show off their wares and vend for them at conventions they can’t make it to. We’re a team of merchants and volunteers working to bring cool things from around the world to conventions all across the US!

Growing out of a wish to cast a spotlight on underexposed artists, we quickly developed from a single planned exhibition at one event into an organization dedicated to appearances at conventions and events around the country. As diverse as the My Little Pony and Fandom communities, our collection includes drawings, paintings, prints, sculptures, digital artwork, customized pony dolls, and custom stuffed toys.

Our goal is to be able to bring this wonderful artwork to people – both inside and outside of the My Little Pony fan community – who otherwise might not have a chance to see such things. Having their work travel and be seen by thousands of people helps bring to light their talent and allows people to find artists who may not have been known about otherwise.

Alongside being deeply involved in the MLP fan community, the Museum prides itself on its charity and outreach activities. Past and present efforts include raising money for “Inked! Art for Africa” (with which Maddy Peters, the voice of Scootaloo, is affiliated), as well as aid for Hurricane Sandy victims.

In addition to coordinating for appearances at some of the largest and most prestigious events in the My Little Pony fan community (such as BronyCon and TrotCon), we’ve also worked together with well-known community organizations such as Everfree Radio, Bronies for Good and the Humble Brony Bundle.
